    <h1>Highlighting</h1>
    <p>The <b>mark</b> element is new in HTML5 and it is used to mark or highlight text in a document</p>
        <h6>Example</h6>
        <p>Here is some content from an article that contains the <mark>searched query</mark>
        that we are looking for. Highlighting the text will make it easier for the user to
        find what they are looking for.</p>
            
    <h1>Bold, Italic and Underline</h1>
    <p>To bold the text <mark>strong and b</mark> tags are used </p>
          <h6>Examples</h6>
          <storng>This text is important!</storng> <!--used to indicate that the text is fundamentally or semantically
            important to the surrounding text--><br>
          <b>This text is bold</b> <!-- indicates no such importance and simply represents text that should
            be bolded-->
    
    <p>For italic <strong>em and i</strong> tags are used</p>
          <h6>Examples</h6>
          <i>This text is italic</i> <!-- simply represents text which should be set off from the normal text around it.
          -->
          <p>"I was forced to read <i> Romeo and Juliet </i> in high school."</p>

          <em>This text is emphasized</em> <!-- used to indicate that the text should have extra emphasis that should be
            stressed-->
          <p>"Would you just <em>submit</em> the edit already?"</p>
            

    <p>For underlined text <b>u</b> tag is used</p>
        <h6>Example</h6>
        <p>This paragraph contains some <u>mispelled</u> text.</p> <!--element itself was deprecated in HTMl 4, it was reintroduced with alternate semantic meaning in
            HTML 5 - to represent an unarticulated, non-textual annotation-->

    <h1>Abbreviation</h1>
        <h6>Example</h6>
        <p>I like to write <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>!</p><!--the title attribute is used to present the full description of such abbreviation-->

    <h1>Inserted, deleted or stricken text</h1>
        <h6>Examples</h6>
        <p>To mark text as inserted, use the <b>ins</b> tag </p>
            <ins>New Text</ins>
        <p>To mark text as deleted, use the <b>del</b> tag </p>
            <del>Deleted Text</del>
        <p>To strike through text, use the <b>s</b> tag </p>
            <s>Struck-through text here</s>

    <h1>superscript and subscript</h1>
        <p>To offset text either upward or downward you can use the tags <b>sup and sub</b> </p>
        <p>To create superscript</p>
        <sup>superscript here</sup>
        <p>To create subscript</p>
        <sub>subscript here</sub>
